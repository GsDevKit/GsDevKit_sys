The files in this directory are tODE `tpz` scripts that are executed by client `script` built-in (type `script -h` into the tODE Shell for more information).

This directory is supplied as a location where you can add your own clinet-side scripts or customize the implementation of the scripts found in $GS_HOME/sys/default/client/tode-scripts.

The primary purpose of client-side scripts is to bootstrap tODE into a stone, since tODE commands cannot be executed on the server until tODE is installed.
